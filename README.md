## ‚ÑπÔ∏è General Info
Ipanema builds the bridge between traditional banks and the blockchain ecosystem. It is a platform that enables banks to grant loans via the Celo blockchain to their customers.

### The Problem
In the last years, decentralized finance protocols that operate independently from banks and the traditional infrastructure recorded a giant growth. The new platforms use blockchains like Ethereum as core infrastructure and enable users to transfer values as digital tokens. Many financial services are already rebuilt in DeFi. Due to the missing authentication tools, loans can only be provided if an asset is locked up in a smart contract as col-lateral. This keeps DeFi developers from creating many more use cases. 
Parallel to this, traditional banks implemented online banking applications that offer a user-friendly frontend with secure KYC solutions meeting all regulatory requirements. The banking systems rely on legacy banking infrastructure that was set up decades ago therefore many systems are not up to date and processes are slow and expensive. 

### Large Opportunity
Blockchains provide layers for settlements and transactions that are faster, more secure, more transparent, and more interoperable than in the banking world. But the lack of providing loans in DeFi is a large opportunity for banks. With Ipanema, they can easily get access to the DeFi world and offer loans in cryptocurrencies to their customers. Ipanema builds the bridge between the traditional world and the blockchain ecosystem, by combining the advantages of banking interfaces with KYC solutions and the open world of blockchains. 

### Team & Background
Ipanema was created as part of the Celo x Huobi Hackathon with a focus on Stablecoin in Web3 &amp; Sustaina-bility. The hackathon offered three topics of which we took the 3rd one 'Stablecoins + DeFi mobile solutions'. 

The Ipanema team consists of the german Capgemini Invent programmers Volker Dufner, Tim Schmitz and Jo-nas Engelhardt.

### Celo: Mobile-First DeFi Platform

[Celo](https://celo.org/) is a fully EVM compatible proof-of-stake layer-1 protocol, featuring a fast ultralight client and built-in seigniorage stablecoins, collateralized by crypto and natural assets.

### Ipanema: Smart Contract
The Ipanema smart contract is written in Solidity and will initially be deployed on the [Alfajores test-net](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet).

The ```ERC20.sol``` Contract deploys a test token that can be used to issue test loans.
The ```multiLoanErc20.sol``` contract enables peer-to-peer loans using any ERC20 token.

### Ipanema: Mobile-First dApp
The Ipanema mobile-first decentralized application is written in Typescript using the [Re-act](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

## üö∂ First Steps

1. [Set up a Testnet Development Wallet](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/testnet-wallet)
2. [Deploy on Celo](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-dapp)
3. [Integrate with Celo](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/integrations)

## Ipanema: Demo Flow

### Authetication
1. Customer creates wallet and enters address into the online banking application
2. Bank verifies wallet

### Taking a loan
3. Customer uses Ipanema frontend to request loan
4. Bank checks loan request and calculates costs and the interest rate
5. Customer takes loan

### Repaying a loan
6. Customer repays loan + interest in time | Bank liquidates loan after the due date has passed

The customer has no collateral by default if the loan is not repaid the bank can take legal actions in the real world in contrast to other DeFi applications. 

## üì£ What comes next?
The current version of Ipanema gives just a small insight into how banks could be integrated into the decentral-ized financial system. 
In the future, updates can be implemented that provide a better user experience, and more functionality and that help to meet current and incoming regulations. 

- Customer verification/KYC: banks are generally not allowed to provide loans to unauthenticated customers. Ipanema will integrate functions that use the bank‚Äôs KYC methods to verify each customer. Example: the cus-tomer enters his wallet address in his online banking application where KYC was already done. The bank will send a verification token to the customer‚Äôs wallet. Only customers with a verification token will be allowed to take loans. 

- Several categories of loans: currently there is only one version of fixed loans, that have to be fully repaid after a certain time. In the future, more versions of loans for example with variable interest rates and variable re-payments could be implemented. 

- Full integration in a bank‚Äôs backend: the bank will be able to implement its risk models and provide each cus-tomer with a calculated interest rate.
